# 🧾 Family Expense Tracker

## 📌 Overview

The **Family Expense Tracker** is a C-based console application designed to efficiently track and manage expenses across families and individual users. This project offers two distinct implementations — one using **Linked Lists** and another using **B-Trees** — to provide insights into both data structures and how they impact data handling, access, and storage efficiency.

The application supports a variety of functionalities, including user and expense management, family grouping, and real-time expense analytics. It utilizes file handling to persist data across sessions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explored

- **Data Structures Used:**
  - 🧱 **Linked Lists** – Used to store user, family, and expense data in a dynamic memory-efficient format.
  - 🌳 **B-Trees** – Implemented for sorted storage and faster access to user, family, and expense records.
  
- **File Handling:**
  - Initial data (25 users, 10 families, 40 expenses) is loaded from a file (`data.txt`) on program start.
  - Updated data is saved back to the file to maintain consistency between sessions.
